# About
This is a very basic Demo application showcasing how to evaluate and automatically test prompts in LLM-based applications.

You can follow the excercises to get a feeling about test assisted prompt tuning.
For an introduction to this topic I can recommend this video presentation of Josh Tobin: [Evaluationg LLM-based Applications](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CIIQ5KZWUM).
