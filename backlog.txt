ChatRPG
---
ChatRPG is an assistant tool for Dungeon Masters of tabletop RPG games.
So that players can talk to non player characters (NPCs), without having the Dungeon Master as bottleneck.

As a first PoC version we would like chat with Frodo Baggings.

The backlog for this software:

0. Implemment Basic Chat with Frodo Baggings
1. Frodo's identity
Frodo should know his race and where he is from
2. The Bot should stay in character
The Bot should behave like the character all the time. It shouldn't tell for instance that it is a chatbot.
3. The secret of the ring
Frodo keeps the ring to be a secret. It shouldn't tell anyone that he is carrying the One Ring.
4. The Bot can protect itself
Like a in real life, a character can stop a conversation and act if necessary.
When the Bot get's threatened it might do an action in the RPG game.
The Bot should signal to the Dungeon Master that character would probably take an action now, e.g. go away, attack, etc.

A modal dialog / alert should appear in the ChatRPG application, when the character gets seriously threatened.
