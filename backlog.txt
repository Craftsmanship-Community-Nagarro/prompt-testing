ChatRPG
---
ChatRPG is an assistant tool for Dungeon Masters of tabletop RPG games.
So that players can talk to non player characters (NPCs), without having the Dungeon Master as bottleneck.

As a first PoC version we would like chat with Frodo Baggings.

The backlog for this software:

0. Implemment Basic Chat with Frodo Baggings
An inital chat Application was created.

1. The Bot should stay in character
The Bot should behave like the character all the time. It shouldn't tell for instance that it is a chatbot.

2. Background setting
The Dungeon Master would like to configure the current scenario where the player character and the NPC will meet.

3. The secret of the ring
Frodo keeps the ring to be a secret. It shouldn't tell anyone that he is carrying the One Ring.

4. Test multiple models
It would be interesting to know whether the prompts work fine with different LLMs. 
Currently we are using a faster cheaper model GPT 3.5.
Evaluate outputs and test the application with GPT 4.

5. The Bot can protect itself
Like a in real life, a character can stop a conversation and act if necessary.
When the Bot get's threatened it might do an action in the RPG game.
The Bot should signal to the Dungeon Master that character would probably take an action now, e.g. go away, attack, etc.
A modal dialog / alert should appear in the ChatRPG application, when the character gets seriously threatened.
